<h1> Hi Eugenia! </h1>

	<br>

	There's something I want to tell you. Though we haven't spent much time together, I really like you and enjoy your company!

	I think that if we spent more time together, we would grow to enjoy our friendship even more.

	Would you be willing to go out with me? I know we are far, but I want to get to know you better. I think it would be nice to walk together in love and in faith.

	P.S. No pressure, if you say "no" or "not yet", I'll understand. I don't want to rush either.
